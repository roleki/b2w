## B2W - A Journey Back to Work

__"A pragmatic project for getting (back to) work as an knowledge worker"__

The project _or journey_ of getting back to work starts right here with this 
projects readme file and will continue as blog posts.. 

The theory is that it is possible (for the literati) to start a career as a 
[knowledge worker][wp:knowledge worker]] with the right management of focus.

This project aims to put together a good virtual work environment and the needed
tools for the task of managing information in a pragmatic way allowing and 
adaptiv evolution to actualize knowledge. 

Note: To get the most out of this projects first steps you need access to 

* __A real [unix shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_Shell)__ 

if you haven't seen one: don't panic you may learn something or enough by
following this project. Hey!.. I said: [don't panic](https://facebook.com).
