# A Journey Back to Work

   _"A pragmatic project to start work (again) as an knowledge worker"_ 

The project or journey of getting back to work starts right here with this projects readme file and 
will continue as blog [posts]("/posts"). 

The theory is that it should be possible to start a career as a [[wikipedia:knowledge worker]]
in general or a [[wikipedia:software engineer]] in particular just with reading/writing skills and the right 
management of focus.

This project aims to put together a good virtual work environment and the needed tools for the task
of manageing information following an agile and pragmatic guideline.
